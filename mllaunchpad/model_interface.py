    Please inherit from this class and put your training code into the
    method "create_trained_model". This method will be called by the framework when
    your model needs to be (re)trained.

    Why not simply use static methods?
        We want to make it possible for create_trained_model to pass extra info
        test_trained_model without extending the latter with optional keyword
        arguments that might be confusing for the 90% of cases where they are
        not needed. So we rely on the smarts of the person inheriting from this
        class to find a solution/shortcuts if they want to do more difficult
        things e.g. want to do the train/test split themselves.
