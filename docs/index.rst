ML Launchpad documentation
==============================================================================
ML Launchpad is an extensible Python package which makes it easy to publish Machine Learning models as RESTful APIs.

It separates the Machine Learning side (how to train, test and to predict) from the environment-specific aspects (local or cloud deployment of the API, database connections, format validation, model storage, etc.).
